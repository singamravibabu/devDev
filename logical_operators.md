# Logical operators
- Logical operators combine Boolean expressions.
- The result of a logical expression is a Boolean value.

## Three types of logical operators
- not
- and
- or

### not operator
- Negation operator: reverses the outcome of an expression
- Syntax:
```
not bool_exp
```

### and operator
- It combines two Boolean expressions.
- The result is a Boolean value (True/False).
- It returns True when both the Boolean expressions are True; otherwise it returns False.
- Syntax
```
bool_exp1 and bool_exp2
```

### or operator
- Combines two Boolean expressions, and returns a Boolean value.
- If one Boolean expression is True then the outcome is True.
- Syntax:
```
bool_exp1 or bool_exp2
```
