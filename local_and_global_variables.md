# Local and Global variables
- Local variables are created inside a function
- Local variable is only accessible inside a function
- Global variables are created outside a function
- Global variables are accessible every where, however, inside function they are read-only.
- We can modify a global variable inside a function, however, it's not recommended. To write (modify) a global variable inside a function we need use the 'global' keyword.
