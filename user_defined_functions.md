# User Defined Functions
> Creating user-defined functions (UDFs) is an important concepts for learners.

### Purpose of user-defined functions (UDFs)
- To reuse the code.
- Automate the process.
- Divide the program into smaller chunks.

```
def func_name([args]):
    block
```

- [args]: optional, they input(s) to the function.

### Calling a function (function call)
- Functions won't execute on their own, so we need to call them using their name:

```
func_name([args])
```
